# 🖼️ Image Separator

**Image Separator** is a Python-based tool that helps you **automatically classify and separate images** based on their contents using face detection. It's designed to organize images from a large dataset into separate folders like **People**, **Dataset**, and **Output**, making it easier for users to work with image-based projects.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Before running the script, make sure to create the following directories in the root of your project:

/Image_Separator
│

├── Dataset/ # Place all input images here

├── People/ # Images with human faces will be moved here, crop them so that they can be used to make encodings.

├── Output/ # Processed or categorized images (optional usage)

└── image_separator.py # Main script


---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Detects and filters images containing human faces  
- 🗂️ Moves images with faces to the `People/` folder  
- 🧹 Keeps your datasets clean and organized

---

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Devid06/Image_Separator.git
   cd Image_Separator
Install dependencies:
```
pip install opencv-python
```
Add your images:

Place all images you want to process in the Dataset/ folder.

Run the script:
```
python image_separator.py
```
Check results:

Images with detected faces will be moved to the Output folder.

🧠 How It Works
The script uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in each image inside the Dataset/ folder.
If a face is found, the image is automatically moved to the People/ directory for further use.

📌 Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV (opencv-python)
